# tg-notify

It is a pretty basic Laravel application created for educational purposes only. It does not perform form's fields validation and it does not store 'sensitive' data in the configuration file.

It contains only one form for entering messages. It works with MySQL table containing text of messages a user creates. The application also send notifications through the Telegram bot when the message have entered.
